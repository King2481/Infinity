# Infinity
 Prototype Arena FPS 2.0

# What is this?
This is an Arena FPS protoype that I made in my spare time. It was built off the lessons I learned from my previous project, which was just called Arena.

# Post Mortem 
While there are some things I wish I could've added (such as private games), I just had to cut the project short due to burn out. That being said, I am far more happy with what I was able to accomplish given what the previous project was. For example, there were some issues with the shotgun that caused hitching if you were a client, which was fixed in this version.

I was (mostly) able to add what I wanted to add, such as skins, a server browser, and a functional create game menu that can toggle between Deathmatch and TDM, would have also loved to create bots in some sort of way but in the end just didn't have the time to program them. 

Despite all that I am happy and this project taught me a lot about making multiplayer shooters and how to reduce bandwidth when calling server RPCs.
